This is an interactive command line app using Node.js to query a database created in MySQL.
The app mimics an online storefront where a customer can request the quantity of an item they would like to buy, and the total price is returned.

To get started, change into the file's directory and enter "Node bamazonCustomer" in the command line.
You will receive an inventory of the available products, their IDs, available stock, price, etc.
Then you wil be asked to provide the ID# and quantity of the item you'd like to buy.
The app will return your total price. 
If the amount requested exceeds the item inventory, the app will return "Insufficient stock!" and prevent purchase.
